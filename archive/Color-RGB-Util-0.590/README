     say rgb_luminance('d090aa');                    # => ffcc33

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  mix_2_rgb_colors
    Usage:

     my $mixed_rgb = mix_2_rgb_colors($rgb1, $rgb2, $pct);

    Mix 2 RGB colors. $pct is a number between 0 and 1, by default 0.5
    (halfway), the closer to 1 the closer the resulting color to $rgb2.

  rand_rgb_color
    Usage:

     my $rgb = rand_rgb_color([ $low_limit [ , $high_limit ] ]);

    Generate a random RGB color. You can specify the limit. Otherwise, they
    default to the full range (000000 to ffffff).

  rgb2grayscale
    Usage:

     my $rgb_gs = rgb2grayscale($rgb);

    Convert $rgb to grayscale RGB value.

  rgb2sepia
    Usage:

     my $rgb_sepia = rgb2sepia($rgb);

    Convert $rgb to sepia tone RGB value.

  reverse_rgb_color
    Usage:

     my $reversed = reverse_rgb_color($rgb);

    Reverse $rgb.

  rgb_luminance
    Usage:

     my $luminance = rgb_luminance($rgb);

    Calculate standard/objective luminance from RGB value using this
    formula:

     (0.2126*R) + (0.7152*G) + (0.0722*B)

    where R, G, and B range from 0 to 1. Return a number from 0 to 1.

  tint_rgb_color
    Usage:

     my $new_rgb = tint_rgb_color($rgb, $tint_rgb, $pct)

    Tint $rgb with $tint_rgb. $pct is by default 0.5. It is similar to
    mixing, but the less luminance the color is the less it is tinted with
    the tint color. This has the effect of black color still being black
    instead of becoming tinted.

  rgb_distance
    Usage:

     my $dist = rgb_distance($rgb1, $rgb2)

    Calculate RGB distance, which is defined as:

     ((R1-R2)**2 + (G1-G2)**2 + (B1-B2)**2)**0.5

    For example, the distance between "000000" and "ffffff" is ~441.67,
    while the distance between "ffff00" and "ffffff" is 255.

  rgb_is_dark
    Usage:

     my $is_dark = rgb_is_dark($rgb)

    Return true if $rgb is a "dark" color, which is determined by checking
    if the RGB distance to "000000" is smaller than to "ffffff".

  rgb_is_light
    Usage:

     my $is_light = rgb_is_light($rgb)

    Return true if $rgb is a "light" color, which is determined by checking
    if the RGB distance to "000000" is larger than to "ffffff".
